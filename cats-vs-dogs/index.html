  <h1>Dogs Have Better Noses</h1>
  <img src="fiona"/>
<p>Dogs can discriminate odors at concentrations nearly 100 million times lower than humans can.</p> 
<p>The wet nose is essential for determining the direction of the air current containing the smell.</p> 
<p>Cold receptors in the skin are sensitive to the cooling of the skin by evaporation of the moisture by air currents.</p>

<h2>Cats Have Better Tongues</h2>
<img src="jimmy"/>
<p>Cats are known for their cleanliness, spending many hours licking their coats.</p> 
<p>The cat's tongue has backwards-facing spines about 500 micrometers long, which are called papillae.</p> 
<p>These are quite rigid, as they contain keratin. These spines allow cats to groom themselves by licking their fur, with the rows of papillae acting like a hairbrush. </p>
