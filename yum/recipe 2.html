<h2>Directions</h2>

		<p>Add 1/3 cup of shaved ice into a large metal bowl and add the Simple Syrup. Next, drain the juice out of the fruit cocktail and pour the fruit, grain powder and then add the red bean paste into the bowl.

		Now add another layer of shaved ice into the bowl. Even out the ice and add the kiwi, mochi rice cakes, strawberries and banana. Then add a scoop of both the strawberry and vanilla ice cream. Pour the milk over the dessert and then the strawberry syrup. Then add the whipped cream, drizzle with hot fudge chocolate syrup and top it with the rainbowy puffs cereal. And finally you add the cherry on top!
